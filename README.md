======================

An android app for the 30 Days of Change plan provided by http://neilarey.com/programs/30-days-of-change.html

I wrote this applicatin for the [Android Apps 101 Course](www.coursera.org/course/androidapps101) I am currently taking. It also will be useful for me to have 
this exercise plan available on my phone when I go to the gym.

The 30 Days of Change plan itself is provided completely free by the author and the only restriction by the author is 
that no one charges for it ever. However, if you find the plan useful, please feel free to [give back](http://neilarey.com/give-back.html) a
little donation to help support Neila Ray's work.
